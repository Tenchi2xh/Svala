# Svala

*Scala + Svelte = Svala*

Basic template for using Scala inside of Svelte.

Read the (very basic) [docs](docs/svala.md) to get an idea of what's going on here!

## Building

You need node, NPM and yarn (`npm install -g yarn`) and then:

```
yarn build
```

## Running

To run the app, run:

```
yarn run preview
```

And then it should be served on http://localhost:4173/.

Note: `yarn run dev` does not work yet with this workflow!
